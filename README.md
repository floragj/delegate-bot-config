# delegate-topic-bot

## Usage

For updating the garden windows team Slack bot in the #pcf-windows and garden-windows-bots channels.

1. Go into the config directory and edit the following files: 
    * `garden-windows.yml`
    * `garden-windows-team.yml`

2. In `garden-windows.yml`, add a new line in the `Users` section with the name as found in [Pairist](https://pair.ist/garden-windows/current). 
    
    After the name, add the user's `User Id` from Slack. To get the `User Id`:

    Inside the Pivotal Slack Workspace, navigate to the user profile for this new team member and in the url you should see this at the end of the path: `team/USER_ID/`.
    
    The format of the new entry should be:
  `<New-User-Name>: <User-Id-From-Slack>`

3. In `garden-windows-team.yml`, add a new entry under `Union` with the name as found in [Pairist](https://pair.ist/garden-windows/current). 

    After the name, add the user's `User Id` from Step 2.
    
    The format of the new entry should be:
`- user: { id: &<New-User-Name> <User-Id-From-Slack> }`

4. Commit and push changes to Github (make sure you're pushing to the garden-windows branch!!)

5. Go to [delegate-bot pipeline](https://garden-windows.ci.cf-app.com/teams/main/pipelines/delegate-bot) and run the deploy job.

# Important Note:

If you are updating the Pivotal Slack bot, you probably want to update the Cloud Foundry one as well. 

To do this:

* Navigate to [CF Slack Interrupt bot](https://github.com/dpb587/cloudfoundry-slack-interrupt-bot) repository and fork it
* Edit the `config/garden-windows.yml` file, using the same logic as above EXCEPT take the `User Id` from Cloud Foundry Slack. **The `User Id` is NOT the same as the Pivotal Slack `User Id`!**
* Submit a pull request to the upstream repo
* Ping Danny Berger to deploy the CF Slack Interrupt bot with the changes
